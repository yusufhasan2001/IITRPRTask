# IITRPRTask1
This repository contains the implementation of a basic binary classification problem. Objective: To predict whether detected radio signals come from a pulsar

Source: Kaggle Exercise https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/3685412

The data itself contains eight measures of this radio signal and a column target_class that indicates if the signal is noise (0) or a pulsar (1). Using this 
data, we train a classifier that can identify pulsars from the radio signal data.

Implemented as part of ongoing internship at IIT Ropar.
